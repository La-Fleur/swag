&gt; I find myself in need of a keyboard handler that traps and hides
&gt; the Print Screen key.  If this key is hit while in graphics mode
&gt; on a LaserJet it causes a line of garbage to print on a thousand
&gt; sheets of paper.... &lt;more or less&gt;.  I'd like to catch it and maybe
&gt; even point it to my own print procedure if possible.  If you can
&gt; dig something up, I'd be most grateful.  (TP6 if possible)

This is the traditional quick and dirty way to thwart PrintScreen:

mem[$0050:0000] := 1;

$0050:0000 is the PrintScreen status byte.  It is set to 1 while
PrintScreen is in operation.  If the PrintScreen button is hit
while the screen is already being printed, the print screen routine
does nothing.  By setting the status byte to 1 yourself, you fool
the PrintScreen routine into thinking the screen is already being
printed and it will terminate without doing anything until you
jiggle the status byte back to the &quot;correct&quot; setting.

Set the status byte back to 0 (mem[$0050:0000] := 0) at the end of
your program so your users will be able to use PrintScreen after
your program has terminated.
