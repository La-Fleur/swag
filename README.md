**Why a site with code mostly from pre-Windows 95 era Turbo Pascal
programming?**

There are a few reasons: the first is nostalgia for anyone who
programmed in this time period the SWAG was an invaluable
resource. Another reason is that most of this stuff is still very
useful in new programming challenges. For example, [calculating
checksums](tree/master/CRC) or [sorting data](tree/master/SORTING) is
still done pretty much the same way.

There is a section on [Borland Delphi](tree/master/DELPHI) (mostly
version 1 and maybe some 2).  There is also a lot to be learned from
this code written back when concerns dealt with fitting your entire
program on a 1.2 meg floppy, running in 64K memory block sizes and on
slower CPUs. Learning from these examples of efficiency illustrated
here can only result in better performance in our programs today.

The Pascal language is alive and well today with products like [Free
Pascal](http://freepascal.org/), [Embarcedero
Delphi](http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), [Turbo
Pascal](http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20803), Virtual Pascal,
[Irie Pascal](http://www.irietools.com/), the [P5
Compiler](http://www.standardpascal.org/p5.html), and GNU Pascal in
use making great programs. So grab a compiler (if you don't already
have one), browse through the snippets, and start programming.
